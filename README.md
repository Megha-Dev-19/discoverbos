# Discover BOS

## Setup & Development

Install Packages:
```
yarn
```

Start development version:
```
yarn dev
```

This will start both the gateway and serve the [bos-workspace](https://github.com/sekaiking/bos-workspace).

If local widgets are not updating, set the flag at localhost:3000/flags to the server location: 'http://127.0.0.1:4040/'
